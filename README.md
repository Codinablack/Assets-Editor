Arch-Mina original repository: https://github.com/Arch-Mina/Assets-Editor

This edited version include all registered creatures that are used on systems like: Bestiary, Prey, Boosted etc.

- Monster window:
   Some informations on the monsters window can change colors when picked, the red highlight means that or this change wont have any effect (for example setting a addon number on a outfit that dont have addons) or if the value is confliction with another list, this last one happens on the ' ID: ' textbox, where the ID set on this place is already being used by another different creature, saving a new creature that have the ID with red colors will overwrite the old monster to the new one.
